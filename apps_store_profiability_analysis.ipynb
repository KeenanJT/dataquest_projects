    "Our aim in this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets. We're working as data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps, and our job is to enable our team of developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build.\n",
    "\n",
    "At our company, we only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use our app. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.\n",

To avoid spending resources with collecting new data ourselves, we should first try to see whether we can find any relevant existing data at no cost. Luckily, these are two data sets that seem suitable for our purpose:\n",

    "1. What is the most common genre? What is the runner-up?\n",
    "    - Most common genre is Games\n",
    "    - Second most common genre is Entertainment\n",
    "2. What other patterns do you see?\n",
    "    - Games, Entertainment, Photo & Video, and Social Networking, 4 of the top 5 app genres are about passing the time.\n",
    "3. What is the general impression — are most of the apps designed for practical purposes (education, shopping, utilities, productivity, lifestyle) or more for entertainment (games, photo and video, social networking, sports, music)?\n",
    "    - Entertainment\n",
    "4. Can you recommend an app profile for the App Store market based on this frequency table alone? If there's a large number of apps for a particular genre, does that also imply that apps of that genre generally have a large number of users?\n",
    "    - Higher number of apps within a genre could mean higher total number of users, but to know if this translates into dollars we'd need to know either the revenue driven, engagement rate, or some kind of proxy to understand value within the app. Entertaining apps have a lower barrier of entry and commitment compared to utility which is usually tied to a problem that needs to be solved, which in turn could have a higher engagement or revenue rate."
